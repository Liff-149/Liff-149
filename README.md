# Hey, I'm Alif 👋

I'm someone who believes that **simplicity is underrated**.

I love writing clean code, building useful things, and keeping noise out of the way — in life and in software.

### 👨‍💻 What I do (mostly)

- Write code that doesn’t fight back
- Explore tools that make tech feel more human
- Ship side projects quietly, but consistently

---

### 🧠 Current focus

- Designing better developer experiences
- Learning something small every day
- Avoiding over-engineering, embracing clarity

### ⚡️ A thought I like

> “The best code is no code at all.  
> But when code is necessary — make it **feel invisible**.”

### 🤐 Fun fact

I don’t always comment my code,  
but when I do — it’s usually a poem.
